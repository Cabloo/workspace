Setup:
=======
- (Optional) Personalize terminator.desktop
- (Optional) Personalize config
- Run install.sh (make sure correct permissions are set)
- Change SSH login in terminator.sh

The config file is automatically symlinked to terminator's config file, so changes to it will occur in terminator on the next start.
